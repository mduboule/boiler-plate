# Boiler plate for JS and SCSS projects #

This repo is mostly a copied-and-modified version of [the Coder Coder's Front-end Boilerplate using Sass and Gulp 4](https://github.com/thecodercoder/frontend-boilerplate). The structure and naming have been changed slightly but it's mostly the same and a sandbox for me to experiment with. Thank you to the Coder Coder for sharing this great script.

## NPM install command for depedencies ##
